Every time we set up monitoring on a server, we faced the same frustration: the agent consumed
more resources than most of the services we were trying to monitor.

Prometheus exporters need a Node.js or Python runtime. Commercial agents run with 200–400 MB of
RAM and 1–5% persistent CPU. On a small VPS or a constrained edge node, that overhead is not
acceptable.

## The requirements we set

We wanted an agent that:

- Compiles to a single static binary with no runtime dependencies
- Consumes under 0.1% CPU and under 10 MB of RAM
- Speaks a standard protocol so we're not locked into any vendor
- Handles network failures gracefully without losing data
- Updates itself without manual intervention

Rust was the obvious choice. No garbage collector, no runtime, direct OS API access, and a
compiler that catches entire classes of bugs before they reach production.

## Why OpenTelemetry

We could have built a custom protocol, but that would mean custom integrations on every backend.
OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) over gRPC is becoming the standard for telemetry transport. Any
modern observability stack — Grafana, Datadog, Honeycomb, your own collector — can receive it.

Choosing OTLP means OxiPulse works with whatever you already have.

## Open source, no lock-in

The agent is Apache 2.0. You can point it at your own OTLP collector — you don't need to use
SecuryBlack's infrastructure. We believe monitoring tooling should be transparent and auditable.

We're releasing OxiPulse as a standalone project because it solves a real problem, and because
we think the community can help make it better faster than we can alone.

## What's next

v0.1.0 covers the core: CPU, RAM, disk, and network metrics over gRPC. On the roadmap:

- Per-process metrics
- Custom metric labels
- Docker and Kubernetes integrations
- A public Prometheus-compatible endpoint as an alternative to OTLP
